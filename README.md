# Bad-image-detection-
In this project we detect over exposed, under exposed and blur photos


# Plan for now

1.   I plan on first try and implement quad trees ( my CS201 project ) to isolate the main parts of the images
one thing that is missing is how can I distinguish good blur from bad blur.

2.   Then I will try diffrent image proceccing techniques to isolate the main object ( I need to do reserch on how to detect to blur ).

3.   Then I will try to learn and implement machine learning algorithms to detect objects and then i will compare results from all the three methods.


# future plan 

find ways to detect similar images and make an app out of it so that any one can use it.
