# Bad-image-detection-
In this project we detect over exposed, under exposed and blur photos


# Plan for now

1.   I plan on first try and implement quad trees ( my CS201 project ) to isolate the main parts of the images
one thing that is missing (i need to think on how to do it) is how can i detect camera blur (good blur) from bad blur (camera + motion blur) 

2.   then i wish to try diffrent image proceccing techniques to isolate the main object ( I need to do reserch on how to detect to blur )

3.   then i will try to learn and implement machine learning algorithms to detect objects and then i will compare results from all the three methods.


# future plan 

find ways to detect similar images and make an app out of it so that any one can use it.
